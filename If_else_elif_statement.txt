Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

Under 18.5 they are underweight
Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
Above 35 they are clinically obese.


Code:

weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
print(type(weight))
print(type(height))

bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
BMI = round(bmi,2)
print(BMI)

if BMI < 18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are underweight.")
elif (BMI >18.5) & (BMI < 25):
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you have a normal weight.")
elif (BMI >25) & (BMI < 30):
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif (BMI >30) & (BMI < 35):
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are obese.")
else:
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are clinically obese.")

Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice:

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
**except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
**unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

Code:


year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
if (year % 4 == 0):
    if (year % 100 == 0):
        if (year % 400 == 0):
            print("Leap year.")
        else:
            print("Not leap year.")
    else:
        print("Leap year.")
else:
    print("Not leap year.")
